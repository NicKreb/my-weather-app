# City Based Weather React App

The goal of this project, is to utilize real-time data and display the current Weather in a user pleasant interface.

It should have the current Weather of the Day, along with other details such as pressure and humidity at the fore front.

As well as a list of the next 5 days known as the forecast.

The forecast should be able to be clicked and additional details of that day will be displayed.

And there should be a search bar that allows you to search any cities with a population of 1m or more.
